# KPMG Interview
All the challenges's code/info are present into their respective folders.

** NOTES:**

Challenge 1 :
   - Made a complete automated 3 tier architecture at Azure.

  - It takes the code from the Github, makes its image via Docker and finally, deploys the app to VM via Jenkins pipeline.

  - The code output is dynamic, you can change/add/delete the records once the app starts. It stores the info in a Database.
   

Challenge 2 :
  - Written a script which will call the instance metadata API and stores its output in a JSON format.

  - Sample output is shared for reference.



Challenge 3 :
  - Written a script will accept the user's input in the form of name and age (space seperated), and will fetch the output based on the key or searched value provided.

  - User needs to provide the input data which will be stored in a file.

  - Sample input data is shared for reference.
